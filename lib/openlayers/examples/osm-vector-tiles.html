title: OSM Vector Tiles
shortdesc: Using OpenStreetMap vector tiles.
docs: >
  A simple vector tiles map with OpenStreetMap vector tiles. **Note**: The tiles used in this example are not optimized for rendering - they clip tiles exactly at the tile boundary instead of adding a buffer, and use geographic coordinates instead of tile relative pixel coordinates in view projection.
